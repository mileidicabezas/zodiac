        <p>Aries loves to be number one, so it’s no surprise that these audacious rams are the first
            sign of
            the zodiac. Bold and ambitious, Aries dives headfirst into even the most challenging
            situations
            (which is appropriate, since the body part associated with Aries is the head). Like their
            fellow
            fire signs, Leo and Sagittarius, Aries is a passionate, motivated, and confident leader who
            builds community with their cheerful disposition and relentless determination.</p>

            Roll out the red carpet, because Leo has arrived. Leo is represented by the lion, and these
            spirited fire
            signs are the kings and queens of the celestial jungle. They’re delighted to embrace their royal
            status:
            Vivacious, theatrical, and passionate, Leos love to bask in the spotlight and celebrate
            themselves. These
            lions are natural leaders and they enjoy cultivating friendships and romances that are
            artistically and
            creatively inspired. Playful Leos have no problem leaning into drama-fueled romances that are
            perfectly
            suited for the tabloids. (In fact, they may even prefer them.) After all, every Leo perceives
            him or herself
            as a celebrity. These astrological divas never get tired of lavish dinners, exclusive parties,
            or decadent
            designer wear.

            Represented by the archer, Sagittarians are always on a quest for knowledge. The last fire
            sign
            of the zodiac, Sagittarius launches its many pursuits like blazing arrows, chasing after
            geographical, intellectual, and spiritual adventures. Fueled by wanderlust, these archers
            can be
            found traversing all corners of the world on thrill-seeking expeditions.

            Taurus is an earth sign represented by the bull. Like their celestial spirit animal, Taureans
            enjoy relaxing in serene, bucolic environments, surrounded by soft sounds, soothing aromas, and
            succulent flavors. Taurus is ruled by Venus, the enchanting planet that governs love, beauty,
            and money. Taurus’s Venusian influence make this earth sign the most sensual of the zodiac:
            These cosmic oxen are enchanted by any physical manifestation of comfort and luxury. Pleasure is
            a necessity for epicurean Taureans and they feel most content when pampered. (Taurus governs the
            neck, so neck caresses are especially irresistible to these bulls.)

            Virgo is an earth sign historically represented by the goddess of wheat and agriculture, an
            association that speaks to Virgo’s deep-rooted presence in the material world. Virgos are
            logical, practical, and systematic in their approach to life. This earth sign is a perfectionist
            at heart and isn’t afraid to improve skills through diligent and consistent practice. Virgo
            rules the digestive system, which makes these earth signs especially attuned to the ingredients
            that make up a whole — in food and in everything else. They're hyper-aware of every detail.

        <p>
            The last earth sign of the zodiac, Capricorn is represented by the sea goat, a mythological
            creature with the
            body of a goat and tail of a fish. Accordingly, Capricorns are skilled at navigating both the
            material and
            emotional realms. They scale the steepest mountains — Capricorn rules the knees, making it
            easier for this sign
            to climb — while simultaneously exploring their psychic strengths. Capricorns tap into their
            inner fortitude to
            overcome whatever stands between them and their long-term goals and they don’t let anything
            distract them from
            getting ahead. Because of their unwavering focus, however, they are often perceived as cold and
            unemotional. Sea
            goats must remember that not every success in life can be featured on a résumé and that
            compassion is as
            important as any professional advancement.

            Have you ever been so busy that you wished you could clone yourself just to get everything done?
            That’s the
            Gemini experience in a nutshell. Appropriately symbolized by the celestial twins, this air sign
            was interested
            in so many pursuits that it had to double itself. Because of Geminis' intrinsic duality, they're
            often falsely
            misrepresented as two-faced. In reality, however, Gemini rarely has a hidden agenda. Playful and
            intellectually
            curious, Gemini is constantly juggling a variety of passions, hobbies, careers, and friend
            groups. They are the
            social butterflies of the zodiac: These quick-witted twins can talk to anyone about anything.
            Find them buzzing
            between happy hours, dinner parties, and dance floors.

            Libra is an air sign represented by the scales (interestingly, the only inanimate object of the
            zodiac), an association that reflects Libra's fixation on balance and harmony. Libra is obsessed
            with symmetry and strives to create equilibrium in all areas of life. These air signs are the
            aesthetes of the zodiac: Ruled by Venus, the planet that governs love, beauty, and money, Libras
            adore high art, intellectualism, and connoisseurship. Suave Libras need to surround themselves
            with stunning objects and create environments that reflect their exquisite tastes. Accordingly,
            these air signs make excellent designers, decorators, art critics, and stylists.

        <p> Despite the word "aqua" in its name, Aquarius is actually the last air sign of the zodiac.
            Aquarius is represented
            by the water bearer, the mystical healer who bestows water, or life, upon the land.
            Accordingly, Aquarius is the
            most humanitarian astrological sign. These revolutionary thinkers fervently support “power
            to the people,” aspiring
            to change the world through radical social progress. Every Aquarian is a rebel at heart:
            These air signs despise
            authority and anything that represents conventionality. Free-spirited and eccentric, they
            can often be identified by
            their offbeat fashion sensibilities, unusual hobbies, and nonconformist attitude.</p>

        <p> Cancer is a cardinal water sign. Represented by the crab, this oceanic crustacean
            seamlessly weaves between
            the sea and shore, representing Cancer’s ability to exist in both emotional and material
            realms. Cancers are
            highly intuitive and their psychic abilities manifest in tangible spaces: For instance,
            Cancers can
            effortlessly pick up the energies in a room. These crabs are highly sensitive to their
            environments, as well
            as extremely self-protective. Much like their celestial spirit animal, Cancers are
            shielded by hard,
            external shells.</p>

            Scorpio is one of the most misunderstood signs of the zodiac. Because of its incredible passion
            and power, Scorpio is often mistaken for a fire sign. In fact, Scorpio is a water sign that
            derives its strength from the psychic, emotional realm. Like fellow water signs, Cancer and
            Pisces, Scorpio is extremely clairvoyant and intuitive.

            Pisces, a water sign, is the last constellation of the zodiac. It's symbolized by two fish
            swimming in opposite directions, representing the constant division of Pisces's attention
            between fantasy and reality. As the final sign, Pisces has absorbed every lesson — the joys and
            the pains, the hopes and the fears — learned by all of the other signs. This makes these fish
            the most psychic, empathetic, and compassionate creatures of the astrological wheel. With such
            immense sensitivity, Pisces can easily become swallowed by emotions and must remember to stay
            grounded in the material realm (appropriately, Pisces rules the feet).
